## Introduction

This is a project that was assigned to us by a [datarabbit.ai](https://www.datarabbit.ai/) company as a recruitment task.
We had to complete it in order to do an internship there.

This task was also an opportunity for us to learn new technologies, 
that we were unfamiliar with at the beginning.
